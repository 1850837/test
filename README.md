<h3>Purpose:</h3>
I will use this space to write some markdown files down as it has been a while I have written in it. 

<b>Part 1 - Unit Testing Introduction: </b>
<p><i>Unit Testing</i> is a systematic approach to validating individual element of code, emphasizing the breadth and depth of test coverage.</p>

<b>Part 2 - Equivalence Classes: </b>
<p><i>Equivalence classes, in the context of unit testing(not discrete mathematics), is the grouping of input values that are exprected to exhibit similar behaviour when used as inputs for the function of method. </i></p>

<b>Part 3 -  Examples: </b>
<p>In this part, you will create a dedicated test class for the <font color=red>Invoice</font> class. We'll start by creating an <font color='magenta'>InvoiceTest</font> class to handle unit tests specifically for the ~~<font color='red'>Invoice</font>~~ class. The aim is to achieve full test coverage for all public functions in the <font color='red'>Invoice</font> class, including the constructor.</p>
