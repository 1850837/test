OOP Design 101:
- Start from a use case
- Identify nouns as potential objects and their data members
- Identify verbs as interactions between these objects
- Identitfy the hierarchical relationship between the objects
- Identify the responsibilities for each object( who does what)
-

Example:
+ Use Case:
Write a program to manage the student's records in a classroom. 
Each student has a unique ID, name and grade.
The program should be able to print all the students in the classroom,
find the grade of a student based on their IDand update the grade of a student. 
The program should write the students' records to a file and also read the records 
from a file.




- A class is a user-defined data type whose variables are objects. These 
objects can have both member variables and member functions. An object is a runtime instantiation of a class.


- Encapsulation: combining a number of items, such as variables and functions, into a single package,
such as an object of some class.
